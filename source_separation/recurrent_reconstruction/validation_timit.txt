Let's start to validate some example on timit by including the whole pipeline.
Including saving everything an calculating SNR, SIR, SDR, SAR.

The architecture of the RNN is the following (except):

                         FWD Pool + BWD Pool
                                  |
                  Female Pool <-------> Male Pool
                        |                  |
                      Dense              Dense

Validation of 10 different couples for the following models:
    * SPECTROGRAMS: (where I can I will also check when resampling 8k vs 16k)
        # DATASET READY
        # multi script ready
        THIS IS ALWAYS MASK NOT DIRECT REGRESSION
        - classic with MSE
            - norm
            - not norm
        - one minus
            - norm
            - not norm
        - force SIR
            - norm
            - not norm

    * PCA24: (also in this case I will check for 8k vs 16k)
        DIRECT REGRESSION
        - classic with MSE
            - norm
            - not norm
        - one minus
            - norm
            - not norm
        - force SIR
            - norm
            - not norm
        MASK REGRESSION
        - classic with MSE
            - norm
            - not norm
        - one minus
            - norm
            - not norm
        - force SIR
            - norm
            - not norm
