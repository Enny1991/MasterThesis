╚══════════════════════════════════════════╝


First I would divide my experiments in 2 big parts:
    - Using Shihab's model with ITDs and modified autoencoder
        - normal deep architectures
        - variational Bayes
        - feed-vs-filtering
    - Doing the source separation with novel recurrent networks
        - Direction detection
        - Denoising
        - Varational autoencoder for denoising
        - Variational Recurrent net for denoising
        - various weights uncertainty
